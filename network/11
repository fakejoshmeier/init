Running 10, the output is en0.  Running ifconfig with en0 gives me all of the
relevant information, and anyone with a brain would be good from there, but
we're not talking about brain people.  So pipe ifconfig en0 into grep "inet " to
find the IP with other info.  If that still is too much data for you, pipe that
into awk "{print $2}", and you'll be left wtih the IP.
The device is en0 and the IP is 10.113.4.25
