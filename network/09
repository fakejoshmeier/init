The given IP addresses change, but otherwise, the results are the same as last
time's.  They both produce the same address, regardless of where I access from.
nslookup 42.fr | grep "Address: " | awk '{print $2}' | sort
163.172.250.11
163.172.250.12
nslookup 42.fr 8.8.8.8 | grep "Address: " | awk '{print $2}' | sort
163.172.250.11
163.172.250.12
